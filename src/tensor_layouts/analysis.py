"""GPU layout analysis: bank conflicts, coalescing, permutation structure.

bank conflicts, global memory coalescing, and permutation cycle structure.
They build on the core algebra but encode hardware knowledge (bank count,

    Only the first ``group_size`` threads are analyzed, matching the

    This avoids overstating conflicts when the layout spans multiple

# F2 linear layout matrix
# =============================================================================
#
# A layout with power-of-2 shapes is a linear map over GF(2).  Each
# coordinate bit maps to an offset bit via a binary matrix M such that
# offset_bits = M @ coord_bits  (mod 2).
#
# Swizzles (XOR operations) are also linear over F2, so they fold
# naturally into the matrix.

def to_F2_matrix(layout: Layout) -> list[list[int]]:
    """Return the F2 (binary) matrix representation of a layout.

    The layout must have power-of-2 shapes in all modes.  The returned
    matrix M has shape (n_offset_bits, n_coord_bits) where:

    - n_coord_bits = log2(size(layout))
    - n_offset_bits = enough bits to represent the codomain

    Each entry is 0 or 1.  The mapping is:
    ``offset_bits = M @ coord_bits  (mod 2)``

    Columns correspond to coordinate bits in colexicographic order
    (mode 0 LSB first, then mode 1, etc.).  Rows correspond to offset
    bits (LSB at row 0).

    When the layout has a swizzle, it is folded into the matrix (XOR
    is linear over F2).

    Only nonnegative-stride layouts are supported. Negative-stride layouts
    are not linear over the unsigned offset-bit space without an added affine
    translation term, so returning a plain matrix would be misleading.

    Args:
        layout: Layout with power-of-2 shapes.

    Returns:
        List of lists representing the binary matrix (row-major).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any shape is not a power of 2.
        ValueError: If any flattened stride is negative.

    Examples:
        # Identity layout
        to_F2_matrix(Layout(4, 1))
        # [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  — 2x2 identity

        # Row-major 4x8
        to_F2_matrix(Layout((4, 8), (8, 1)))
        # 5x5 permutation matrix (swaps row/col bit groups)
