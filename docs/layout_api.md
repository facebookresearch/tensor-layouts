# Layout Algebra API

This document covers the core `tensor_layouts` API: constructing layouts,
querying their properties, and applying the four algebraic operations
(compose, complement, divide, product).

For runnable examples see [`examples/layouts.py`](../examples/layouts.py).
For visualization see [`docs/viz_api.md`](viz_api.md).

## What is a Layout?

A `Layout` is a function from logical coordinates to memory offsets:

```
offset = sum(coord_i * stride_i)
```

It is defined by a `(shape, stride)` pair.  The **shape** describes the
logical domain (how many elements along each dimension); the **stride**
describes how far apart elements are in memory along that dimension.

```python
from tensor_layouts import Layout

col_major = Layout((4, 8), (1, 4))   # offset(i,j) = i + 4*j
row_major = Layout((4, 8), (8, 1))   # offset(i,j) = 8*i + j
```

Shapes can be **hierarchically nested** — tuples of tuples — to describe
tiled access patterns, interleaved threads, or any multi-level structure:

```python
tiled = Layout(((2, 3), (2, 4)), ((1, 6), (2, 12)))
# 2x2 tiles arranged in a 3x4 grid = 6 rows x 8 columns
```

## Construction

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Layout(shape, stride)` | Explicit shape and stride |
| `Layout(shape)` | Column-major strides computed automatically |
| `Layout(layout_a, layout_b)` | Bundle two layouts as modes of one layout |

```python
Layout((4, 8), (1, 4))   # explicit
Layout((4, 8))            # same as above (column-major default)
Layout(8, 2)              # 1D: 8 elements with stride 2
Layout((4, 8), (0, 1))   # broadcast: all rows map to same offsets
```

## Coordinate Mapping

Call a layout to map coordinates to offsets:

```python
layout = Layout((4, 8), (1, 4))

layout(2, 3)    # 14  — multi-dimensional coordinate
layout(14)      # 14  — flat index (column-major order through domain)
```

## Query Functions

All query functions work on layouts, tuples, and ints.

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `size(L)` | Total number of elements | `size(Layout((4, 8))) == 32` |
| `cosize(L)` | Max offset + 1 (codomain span) | `cosize(Layout((4, 8), (8, 1))) == 32` |
| `rank(L)` | Number of top-level modes | `rank(Layout((4, 8))) == 2` |
| `depth(L)` | Maximum nesting depth | `depth(Layout(((2,3), 4))) == 2` |
| `mode(L, i)` | Extract mode `i` as a Layout | `mode(Layout((4, 8), (1, 4)), 0) == Layout(4, 1)` |

## Iteration

`iter_layout(L)` yields `(coordinate, offset)` pairs for every element,
iterating in colexicographic order (flat index 0, 1, 2, ...).

`Layout` supports `__iter__` (yields coordinates) and `__len__`:

```python
layout = Layout((4, 8), (1, 4))

len(layout)                        # 32
list(layout)                       # [(0, 0), (1, 0), ..., (3, 7)]

for coord in layout:
    offset = layout(coord)         # map coordinate to offset

# iter_layout yields (coord, offset) pairs
for coord, offset in iter_layout(layout):
    ...

# Collect unique offsets
{layout(c) for c in layout}
```

## Utility Functions

Higher-level helpers like `make_ordered_layout`, `tile_to_shape`,
`make_layout_like`, and `tile_mma_grid` live in `tensor_layouts.layout_utils`
and should be imported explicitly:

```python
from tensor_layouts.layout_utils import make_ordered_layout

col_major = make_ordered_layout((4, 8))           # (4,8):(1,4)
row_major = make_ordered_layout((4, 8), (1, 0))   # (4,8):(8,1)
```

## Layout Manipulation

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `flatten(L)` | Remove all nesting, produce flat modes |
| `coalesce(L)` | Merge adjacent modes with compatible strides |
| `sort(L)` | Reorder modes by stride (ascending) |
| `append(L, M)` | Add mode M after L's modes |
| `prepend(L, M)` | Add mode M before L's modes |
| `group(L, i, j)` | Nest modes i..j into a single hierarchical mode |
| `upcast(L, n)` | Reinterpret from finer to coarser coordinates (÷ n) |
| `downcast(L, n)` | Reinterpret from coarser to finer coordinates (× n) |

### upcast / downcast

`upcast(layout, n)` reinterprets a layout from a finer coordinate space to
a coarser one.  Mirrors CuTe's `upcast<N>`.  The typical use is converting
a layout in **bit** coordinates to **element** coordinates by dividing by
the element width in bits.

For the stride-1 (innermost) mode, the shape shrinks by `n`.  All strides
are divided by `n`.  `downcast` is the inverse.

```python
from tensor_layouts import Layout, upcast, downcast

# Bit layout for SM75 LDMATRIX x4 (dst side)
bits = Layout((32, (32, 4)), (32, (1, 1024)))

# Convert to fp16 elements (16 bits each)
elems = upcast(bits, 16)    # Layout((32, (2, 4)), (2, (1, 64)))

# Convert back
assert downcast(elems, 16) == bits
```

## Tuple Arithmetic

These operate on the nested integer tuples that make up shapes and strides.

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `prefix_product(t)` | Running product (exclusive) | `prefix_product((2,3,4)) == (1,2,6)` |
| `suffix_product(t)` | Running product from right | `suffix_product((2,3,4)) == (12,4,1)` |
| `inner_product(a, b)` | Sum of element-wise products | `inner_product((2,3), (4,5)) == 23` |
| `elem_scale(a, b)` | Element-wise multiply | `elem_scale((2,3), (4,5)) == (8,15)` |

`prefix_product` computes column-major strides; `suffix_product` computes
row-major strides.

## Shape Factorization

`shape_div(shape, d)` and `shape_mod(shape, d)` factor a hierarchical shape
into the part that remains and the part that was consumed, proceeding from
the innermost modes first.

```python
shape_div((6, 2), 3)  # (2, 2)
shape_mod((6, 2), 3)  # (3, 1)

# Complementary size identity for supported inputs:
size(shape_div((6, 2), 3)) * size(shape_mod((6, 2), 3))  # 12
```

Policy note: this Python implementation intentionally uses a stricter scalar
rule than dynamic CuTe C++. At each scalar recursive step, either the shape
must divide the divisor or the divisor must divide the shape. If neither is
true, `shape_div` raises `ValueError`:

```python
shape_div(12, 4)  # 3
shape_div(4, 12)  # 1
shape_div(6, 4)   # ValueError
shape_div(4, 6)   # ValueError
```

This differs from dynamic CuTe C++, which may return `2` and `1` for the
last two cases. The stricter Python rule matches `pycute` and keeps
`shape_div`/`shape_mod` complementary for the educational runtime algebra.

## Core Algebra

### compose(A, B)

Function composition: `C(i) = A(B(i))`.

B selects which elements of A to visit, and in what order.  The result has
B's shape.

```python
compose(Layout(8, 2), Layout(4, 1))  # Layout(4, 2)
# B picks indices 0..3 from A; A maps each to 0,2,4,6

compose(Layout((4, 8), (8, 1)), (2, 4))  # Layout((2, 4), (8, 1))
# Select the top-left 2x4 subblock (mode-by-mode with shape tiler)

compose(Layout(((2, 3), 8), ((1, 2), 6)), ((2, 3), 4))
# Layout(((2, 3), 4), ((1, 2), 6))
# Nested tuple tilers recurse within the corresponding mode instead of
# being flattened into a single stride-1 layout.
```

When `A` is a `Swizzle`, the result is a `Layout` with an embedded swizzle.

### complement(L, bound)

The layout that fills in L's codomain gaps up to `bound`.

```python
complement(Layout(4, 2), 16)  # Layout((2, 2), (1, 8))
# L visits {0,2,4,6}; complement visits the gaps {0,1} and extends to 16
```

Together, `Layout(L, complement(L))` covers every offset exactly once.

### logical_divide(L, T)

Split L into `(tile, rest)` — the core tiling operation.

```python
logical_divide(Layout(16, 1), 4)  # Layout((4, 4), (1, 4))
# 4-element tiles, 4 tiles total

logical_divide(Layout(4, 3), 4)   # Layout((4, 1), (3, 0))
# CuTe canonicalizes any extent-1 tile/rest mode to stride 0.

logical_divide(Layout(((2, 3), 8), ((1, 2), 6)), ((2, 3), 4))
# Divide mode 0 recursively by (2, 3), and mode 1 by 4.
```

Variants control result organization:

| Function | Result structure |
|----------|-----------------|
| `logical_divide` | `((tile0, rest0), (tile1, rest1), ...)` |
| `zipped_divide` | `((tiles), (rests))` |
| `tiled_divide` | `((tiles), rest0, rest1, ...)` |
| `flat_divide` | `(tile0, tile1, rest0, rest1, ...)` |

When `T` is a true `Layout`, the divide variants preserve its stride
structure instead of silently reducing it to `T.shape`:

```python
A = Layout((8, 8), (1, 8))
T = Layout((2, 2), (1, 4))

logical_divide(A, T)  # Layout(((2, 2), (2, 8)), ((1, 4), (2, 8)))
zipped_divide(A, T)   # same as logical_divide(A, T)
tiled_divide(A, T)    # Layout(((2, 2), 2, 8), ((1, 4), 2, 8))
flat_divide(A, T)     # Layout((2, 2, 2, 8), (1, 4, 2, 8))
```

### logical_product(A, B)

Replicate A's pattern at each position B describes.

```python
logical_product(Layout(4, 1), Layout(3, 1))  # Layout((4, 3), (1, 4))
# 4-element tile repeated 3 times: offsets [0..3], [4..7], [8..11]
```

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `logical_product` | Concatenates tile and replication |
| `blocked_product` | Interleaves corresponding modes |
| `raked_product` | Interleaves within each tile |

## Inverse

| Function | Property |
|----------|----------|
| `right_inverse(L)` | `L(R(i)) == i` for all valid i |
| `left_inverse(L)` | `R(L(i)) == i` for all valid i |
| `max_common_layout(A, B)` | Largest layout that divides both A and B |

## Swizzle

`Swizzle(bits, base, shift)` is an XOR-based permutation for GPU shared
memory bank conflict avoidance:

```python
sw = Swizzle(3, 0, 3)
sw(offset)  # offset XOR ((offset >> 3) & 0b111)
```

Compose a Swizzle with a Layout to embed it:

```python
swizzled = compose(Swizzle(3, 0, 3), Layout((8, 8), (8, 1)))
# swizzled(i, j) applies the XOR after computing the linear offset
```

## Tensor

See [`docs/tensor_api.md`](tensor_api.md).

## Tile

`Tile(L0, L1, ...)` is a tuple of Layouts for mode-by-mode composition:

```python
layout = Layout((12, 8), (8, 1))
tiler = Tile(Layout(3, 1), Layout(4, 1))
compose(layout, tiler)  # Layout((3, 4), (8, 1)) — top-left 3x4 subblock
```

A plain tuple of ints `(3, 4)` works as shorthand for
`Tile(Layout(3, 1), Layout(4, 1))`.

## GPU Analysis

GPU-specific analysis functions live in `tensor_layouts.analysis`.
See [`docs/analysis_api.md`](analysis_api.md).
